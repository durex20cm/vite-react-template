## Commit Message Generation

When generating commit messages, ALWAYS follow the conventional commit format defined in `.gitmessage`:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Commit Types:

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools
- `git`: Git related operations, like Merge

### Rules for Commit Messages:

1. **Type**: Choose the most appropriate type from the list above
2. **Scope**: (optional) The scope of the change (e.g., auth, api, ui, s3, websocket)
3. **Description**:
   - Use imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
   - Don't capitalize first letter
   - No period (.) at the end
   - Keep it concise but descriptive
4. **Body**: (optional) Include motivation for the change and contrasts with previous behavior
5. **Footer**: (optional) Reference any issues or breaking changes

### Examples:

```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 authentication support

Implements Google and Facebook OAuth2 login flows with JWT token generation.

Fixes #123
```

```
fix(api): resolve user profile update validation error

The validation was failing for optional fields. Now properly handles null values.

Closes #456
```

```
refactor(ui): extract reusable button component

Moved common button logic to shared component to reduce code duplication.
```

## Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript/JavaScript code with accurate examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- Structure files: exported component, helpers, static content, types

## Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard)
- Favor named exports for components
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types

## Other Rules

- Follow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter
- First think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode
- Confirm, then write code!
- Always write correct, up-to-date, bug-free, fully functional and working, secure, performant and efficient code
- Focus on readability over being performant
- Fully implement all requested functionality
- Leave no todos, placeholders or missing pieces
- Be sure to reference file names
- Be concise, minimize any other prose
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, say so. If you do not know the answer, say so instead of guessing
